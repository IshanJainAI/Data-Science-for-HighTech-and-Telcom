### Churn reduction in the telecom industry

    - Customer churn in the telecom industry poses one of the most significant risks to loss of revenue. 
    - The average churn rate in the telecom industry is approximately 2% per month and could be as high as 50-60% annually for prepaid services.
    - Since the cost of acquiring new customers is up to 25 times higher than the cost of retaining them, fostering customer loyalty is key.
